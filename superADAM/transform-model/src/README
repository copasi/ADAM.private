The main duty of this helper module is to add in polynomial functions
given transition tables (tt), or boolean functions.  However,
transition tables can also be generated.  The function can also remove
this data from a model (mainly used during testing).

This module implements several functions:

1. transform-model (input: task, output: json model)
2. make-transform-task [add|remove] [poly|tt|bool] (input: json model, output: task)
3. verify-model (input and output: json model)

The main one is the first, the 2nd and 3rd are there to help with testing
