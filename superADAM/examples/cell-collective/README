These boolean models are taken from the web site:

        http://thecellcollective.org/

    Click on "Models", currently, this is the resulting link:

For each of these, I by hand downloaded transition table versions of
these (obtaining a zip file), and then used code which currently
resides in transform-model/src/read-cell-collective-model.m2 to
generate these files.  It is not exactly automated, as the packaging
and download process took some time.  And one needs to use the m2 code
"by hand" currently.  But it mostly works.

One model was too large for transition tables.  TODO: grab the boolean
function versions of these models.
