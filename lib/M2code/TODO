1. TT to polynomial
2. polynomials to TT
3. LM (in ginsim format) to polynomial (GS2PDS.m2...) IGNORE THIS FOR NOW
4. Boolean Model (using ~ + *, or NOT, AND, OR) to polynomial

5. (probabilistic or not) polynomial model --> brute force exhaustive enumeration of state space, generating a graphviz file
  (super old perl code) Would be nice to replace this by cyclone?
  output graph is not useful for even medium size input (for prob models)
6. polynomial model --> one initial state --> get graphviz file of the trajectory
7. polynomial model, limit cycle lengths (sizes 1,2,3 usually) --> get steady states and limit cycles of given lengths

8. polynomial model --> dependency graph (currently done by regulatory.pl)
9. large poly model --> calculate dynamics by brute force, but no graph (java/cyclone analysis executable)

get rid of dvd_stochastic_runner.pl, if possible
  note: cyclone doesn't handle prob input, and also doesn't generate a graph

all of the functions/files called from adam.pl are the ones we want to have "json" versions of.

functionality that we are not sure if they work:  either throw these out, or test them and make sure they are useful.
  a. analysis of conjunctive networks (conjunctiveNetwork.rb)
    need to check that the network is conjunctive!
    a1. check that the code is correct. 
      One way: use small systems that work with limitCycle code from above, and check that the answers are the same.
  b. analysis by feedback cycles (circuits.rb)
    Probably: remove this one?

What about SDDS stuff?  Ask Seda.

Petri nets (snoopy format): throw this out.

openPDS: models with parameters.  Ask Seda about this.
