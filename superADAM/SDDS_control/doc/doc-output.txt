This will be an input for the SDDS for simulation. The output json file should contain: 
1. A SDDS:  a transition table with propensity parameters. This is the
same as the model given the input json file.
2. Control Policy: a list of control actions as binary vectors. The control policy is given as binary vectors where a "0" entry
means no control and an entry of "1" means control. For instance, if there
are 2 control nodes and 3 control edges, then a control action is a
binary vector of size 5, e.g. (0,1,0,1,1), (1,1,0,0,1), etc.
