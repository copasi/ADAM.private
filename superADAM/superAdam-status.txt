Hi Alan,

How are you doing? I hope you are doing great and everything is fine on this early 2015.
I wanted to come back to you regarding superADAM.
Indeed, we are now closer than ever to have a first functional version but I need your help at this stage to move forward.
1. Have you created sample input and output JSON files for your program that comply with the spec (see ADAM.private/superADAM/doc/json-standard-formats.txt) ?
2. Where does your code stand regarding to the acceptance of a standardized JSON file as an input and the creation of a standardized JSON file as an output?
Thanks a lot!

Hi David,

How are you doing? I hope you are doing great and everything is fine on this early 2015.
I wanted to come back to you regarding superADAM.
Indeed, we are now closer than ever to have a first functional version but I need your help at this stage to move forward.
1. Following our work last time, we need to adapt the JSON file format to make sure it complies to the format described in the doc (see ADAM.private/superADAM/doc/json-standard-formats.txt). I tried to modify the input file myself (see input_small_ex.json) but I am really not sure it is complete and/or is coherent. Could you please go through it to validate it is (a) complete with all the info you need (b) coherent in respect to the final JSON format spec ? 
2. Could you also create a sample JSON output file that complies to the spec while outputing all the required information ?Once I have this, I will be able to adapt the JSON input/output code to reflect the changes.
Thanks a lot!

Hello Reinhard, Hello Mike,

Following our last call conference, I went through the superADAM repository in order to assess where we stand and what remains to be done. Here is what I think (I might have missed some things) the status is:
* basicRevEng/Brandy ----> input JSON OK. output JSON OK. test OK. Ready to containerize.
* BNReduction/Franziska ----> input JSON KO. output JSON KO. test KO. No trace of JSON input/output implementation in the git repository.
* gfan/(maintainer?) -----------> input JSON KO. output JSON KO. test KO. No code in repository. Empty directory.
* limit-cycles-via-gb/Mike -> input JSON OK. output JSON OK. test KO. limit-cycles-via-gb works but basic-limit-cycles-via-gb is expecting parameters outside the json file. Needs fixing.
* RandomSampling/Seda ---> input JSON OK. output JSON OK. test KO. Container KO. Ready to containerize.had no connection to download the dependency but it looks ok.
* REACT/Paola ---> input JSON OK. output JSON OK. test KO. Container OK. Need implementation of Mike's random generator to enable proper testing.
* SDDS/Seda ---> input JSON OK. output JSON OK. test KO. Container OK. 
* SDDS_control/David --> input JSON KO. output JSON KO. test KO. Container KO. Need review of input JSON file by David to validate the new format. Need to write a standard output JSON file.
* transform-model/Mike --> input JSON OK. output JSON OK. test KO. Container KO. If I understood correctly, Mike wanted to improve transform-model in order to output a full featured JSON task instead of only the transformed model
* TransitionTable2BooleanNetwork/Alan --> input JSON KO. output JSON KO. test KO. Container KO. No trace of JSON input/output implementation in the git repository.
* I did not see any of Helena's code. Which module is she responsible for?

To move forward, I will email everyone from whom I need stuff to be done with you in cc.
Also, Reinhard, if you could provide me with the basic workflows you would like to see implemented that would be very useful to me.

Thanks a lot!
