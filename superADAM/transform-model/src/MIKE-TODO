This is a list of things for me (or others) to do next:

- verify routines: check semantics of model, timeseriesdata, others?
- make sure all json files work, and use the new formats
- limit cycles by gb: get this totally working
- talk to Brandy, we will get basicRevEng working together
- bug people about keeping superADAM clean, getting their parts done, doc, etc.
