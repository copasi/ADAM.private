discretize (executable)

-----------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------
Running discretize:

"discretize sample_data1.txt sample_data2.txt"

produces files sample_data1.txt.out and sample_data2.txt.out .  The first 
line gives the cardinality of the finite field.  Whereas in

"discretize sample_data1.txt"

the new file has a 0 in the first line, if there was a problem.

program you now have), see
