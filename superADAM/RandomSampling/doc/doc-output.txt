description: basin of attractors of a large system using random sampling

type: randomSamplingOutput

basinOfAttractors: The code randomly picks an initial state and computes their trajectories until the initial state reaches an attractor. An attractor can be a fixed point (steady state) or a limit cycle with some length. This is repeated many times, depending upon the specified samplingSize. basinOfAttractors is an array of hash tables consisting of attractors and their sizes.

The following information is provided for "in-case-we-will-need-them"
purposes: numberVariables, fieldCardinality, samplingSize.
