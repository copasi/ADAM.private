This container determines the wiring diagram of a polynomial dynamical
system model.

Input is json, of type: PolynomialDynamicalSystemSet
Output is json, of type: DirectedGraph

Generally, the input should be a single polynomial dynamical system,
but if it contains multiple polynomials per node, then only the first
one is considered.
